# What is this?
This repository is a collection of my thoughts on various things in my life

# How to compile
- python3 main.py
- cd tex
- latexmk -pdf main.tex

# Math
- Every statement is written to be minimal, useful and composible
- Every statement has a family tree using which can be traversed using inline links to its parent statements
- Incomplete statements can be found by searching for `TODO` or `No Significance?`

# DAG visualization
- After compiling a standalone html file is created in the same directory which visualizes all statements in a directed acyclic graph
