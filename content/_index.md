# Research Projects

## stick-solo

Stick-figure agents that climb in free-solo style.
This project models climbing agents using arm manipulators.
It illustrates the inverse kinematics of manipulators using closed-form, open-form, sample-based methods.
It incorporates center of mass term in inverse kinematics to generate a natural looking motion.
It illustrates the need and versetality of using a learning based method for a particular situation.
It shows a deep RL method to predict optimal neck position for hold to hold movement.
