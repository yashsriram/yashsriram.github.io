A [diff drive robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_wheeled_robot) has a orientation unit vector __c__.

We want to align it with orientation unit vector __t__.

How should robot turn to do this the fastest?

- [ ] Always turn left,
- [ ] Always turn right
- [x] Direction of $+\frac{(c \times t)}{|c| . |t|}$
- [ ] Direction of $-\frac{(c \times t)}{|c| . |t|}$
