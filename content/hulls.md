# Convex Hull

For a given set of points, convex hull is the convex polygon constructed by a subset of points such that all points lie inside the polygon.
The following interactive example illustrates it.

| keyboard/mouse | action |
| --- | --- |
| `c` | generate convex hull of given points |
| `left mouse click` | to place a new point |
| `s` | sample a few points |
| `r` | remove everything |
