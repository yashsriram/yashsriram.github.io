# planar intersections


## linesegment, linesegment

- $\ddot{PQ}$ and $\ddot{RS}$ are line segments.
- $\bar{PQ}$ and $\bar{RS}$ are lines.
- $P \nmid \bar{RS} \nmid Q$ means points P and Q are on opposite sides of line RS.

1. $\ddot{PQ}$ and $\ddot{RS}$ intersect
$\rightarrow$
$P \nmid \bar{RS} \nmid Q$
and
$R \nmid \bar{PQ} \nmid S$
1. $P \nmid \bar{RS} \nmid Q$
and

$\rightarrow$
$\ddot{PQ}$ and $\ddot{RS}$ intersect
1. $P \nmid \bar{RS} \nmid Q$
and
$R \nmid \bar{PQ} \nmid S$
$\leftrightarrow$
$\ddot{PQ}$ and $\ddot{RS}$ intersect

What is the necessary condition for two line segments PQ and RS to intersect?
- [ ] P, Q should be on opposite sides of line RS
