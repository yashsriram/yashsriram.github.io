Estimate plane position using particle filter.

A airplane (green circle) is moving right on line (green line).

The altitude of airplane is known. The position of airplane is NOT known to us.

A mountain range (white curve) is known already to us.

We get distance from airplane to mountains as a measurement.

We need to estimate where the airplane is based on the terrain and measurements.

Particles are represented by (red circle)s.
