A quaternion can be described by 3 numbers.

x-coordinate and z-coordinate of axis of rotation and the angle of rotation.

It can be visualized as a cylinder axis aligned with y-axis.

The claim is that a cylinder with radius 1 and height PI placed on x-z plane spans a cone in terms of physical object rotation. Make an interactive program with this cylinder and corresponding rotation visualized. False claim.
