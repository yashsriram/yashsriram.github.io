  \item modelling uncertainity using stochasticity
  \item given a parametrized "stochastically noisy" model with stimulus and response (vector) variable and some samples, the process of estimating parameters (a.k.a fitting model). Using optimization for this estimation. Other non-optimization ways of doing the same. The essence of ML.

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
  \item $(x_i - min) / (max - min)$ set of values vs normalizing set of values, show they are not equal in some instances and properties of each
  \item emphasize diff b/w
    \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
        \item min(sum(abs(residual))) $\equiv$ min(Sum of Absolute Errors). The average of SAE is MAE
        \item min(sum(residual * residual)) $\equiv$ min(Sum of Sqaured Errors). The average of SSE is MSE
        \item min(sum(perpendicular distance)) $\equiv$ min(Sum of Perpendicular Errors). The average of SPE is MPE
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Thinking mean and variance visually, mean of a list of numbers plotted on a co-ordinate system is "the rough line passing through the center", take differences from the rough center line to actual values and square them. Each of these towers or inverted towers can be thought to represent "certain variation" from the mean. Average (/n-1) of all this is defined as "variance". Etymology of "variance". observed the sqaured fn to ignore signs and preserve differentiability. Mind blown!!!. And all this from visualizing the definitions.
  \item R-squared = Explained variation / Total variation. what it means (capturing the variation for just the samples in context and does not say anything about predictablility of model), and especially what it does not mean (good/bad model (patterns in residual plots)). Is it scale invariant?
  \item Shallow vs deep classifiers $\equiv$ seperate description and classification vs together description and classification.

  \item Systemetic case expansion
  \item Working with examples
  \item Arrays that index main arrays to do things :P
  \item Sometimes things to be done in second loop can be done directly in first

\todo : add some structure

\begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
    \item Statically typed vs Dynamically typed == Compile time vs Run time type inferrence.
    \item Compiled vs Interpreted == Transforming code to target machine code before running vs No transformation before running. Compiled might be faster because
        \begin{enumerate}[nolistsep]
            \item It is not reading the code and transforming it for every line.
            \item It can do global optimizations which might not be possible in interpreted as its field of view is local.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item Statically vs Dynamically typedness is property of language. Compilation vs Interpration is the property of implementation not language; saying python is an interpreted language is wrong. Any language can be compiled. Any language can be interpreted.
    \item Define, map and visualize the terms: Memory safety, Memory containment and Type safety.
