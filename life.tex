\title{What is the purpose of life?}
\author{}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

Time and time again I have asked this question.
I don't have an answer yet.
Because I don't really know what I am or what anything means absolutely.
I think I will never do.
I feel that I am just driven by some innate life force in me, that keeps me going.
My will of fire, if you will.
Everything is an artifact of that.
So even something that is (considered) as absolute as math to me is a made-up artifact of human mind.
But I believe in it, the will of fire.
I am just a stupid clueless guy exactly like everyone else, but the point is `I am!' and `I have a will of fire' so `I will!'.
So I guess my purpose is very simple, to be peaceful, joyful and earn happiness and fun, and really try to share it with others people.
This to me is life, literally everything else (Science, Philosophy, Values etc...) are ways of enabling it while they themselves are a part of me.
