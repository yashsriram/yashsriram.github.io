  \defname{Mathematics}

  \defdescription{It is a way of using imagination to solve problems. The essence is that we have a problem we try to use our imagination to come up with something that solves the problem. There is no further restriction on the definition of math.}

  \defsignificance{Concepts developed during this process like algebra, calculus etc... are just tools, not the math itself. We can always create new tools and discard old ones.}
