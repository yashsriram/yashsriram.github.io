\chapter{what is mathematics to me?}

\defn{Mathematics}{
Math in itself has no universal definition.
I think of it is a way of using imagination to solve problems.
The essence is that we have a problem and we try to use our imagination to come up with something that solves the problem. There is no further restriction on the definition of math.
}{
Concepts developed during this process like algebra, calculus etc... are just tools, not the math itself. We can always create new tools and discard old ones.
}{}

\defn{MathematicalTool}{
  An idea refined and carved iteratively using imagination that is useful to solve some problem
}{
  This is a natural construct to have while developing mathematics.
