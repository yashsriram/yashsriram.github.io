\begin{definition}
  \label{def:continuous_set}

  \textbf{An ordered set [\ref{def:ordered_set}] which has no discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a continuous set.}

  \defusecase{To represent sets like the set of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum of light}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:contiguous_set}

  \textbf{An ordered set [\ref{def:ordered_set}] which has a discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a contiguous set.}
