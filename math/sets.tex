\section{what is a set?}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:equality}

  \textbf{Two things are equal in a mathematics analysis iff one can be replaced with another at any place in the analysis}

  \defsignificance{}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  \label{def:set}

  \textbf{A set is a collection of things (also called elements) in which no two things picked without replacement from the collection are equal.}

  \defsignificance{To represent collection of differently colored balls in an urn, etc...}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:ordered_set}

  \textbf{A set in which for any two elements picked without replacement, one element is higher than the other}

  \defsignificance{To represent collection of etc...}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:set_cardinality}

  \textbf{The cardinality of a set [\ref{def:set}] or an ordered set [\ref{def:ordered_set}] is the number of elements in it.}

  \defsignificance{A name for count of elements in the collection. Don't really know why they didn't call it `size' or `length'}
\end{definition}

\section{continuous vs contiguous ordered sets}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:continuous_set}

  \textbf{An ordered set [\ref{def:ordered_set}] which has no discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a continuous set.}

  \defsignificance{To represent sets like the set of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum of light}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:contiguous_set}

  \textbf{An ordered set [\ref{def:ordered_set}] which has a discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a contiguous set.}

  \defsignificance{To represent sets like the ordered set of 7 colors [Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red]}
\end{definition}
