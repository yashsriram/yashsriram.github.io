\defn{Set}{
  A set $S$ is a collection of things (also called elements) $ e_1, e_2, e_3, ... e_n $ ( EnumeratedNotation )from which any two things picked without replacement are not equal ( Equality ). The relationship is written as $ S = \{ e_1, e_2, e_3, ... e_n \} $.
}{
  To represent collection of differently colored balls in an urn, etc...
}

\defn{Union}{
  A union of two sets ( Set ) A and B is a new set which contains each and every element in A and B with repetitions removed if any. Denoted by $ A \cup B $.
}{
  A basic operator to combine sets and ordered sets
}

\defn{OrderedSet}{
  An ordered set is a Set where there exists an Order b/w every pair of elements in it. In the EnumeratedNotation of this set the picking of elements is done such that, for any two elements $ a < b $, $a$ is picked before $b$ and thus $a$ has a smaller subscript than $b$ in the enumerated notation.
}{
  Useful to represent set of heights of students in a class, etc...
}

\defn{ContinuousSet}{
  An OrderedSet which has no discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a continuous set.
}{
  To represent sets like the set of all wavelengths in the visible spectrum of light
}

\defn{ContiguousSet}{
  An OrderedSet which has a discrete separation b/w any two of its elements is called a contiguous set.
}{
  To represent colors in the rainbow in order [Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red]
}
