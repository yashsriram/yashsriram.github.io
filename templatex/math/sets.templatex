${ add_statement(

'Set',

r'''
A set $S$ is a collection of things (also called elements) from which any two things picked without replacement are not equal @equality@. If the elements are denoted by $ e_1, e_2, e_3, ... e_n $ the set is denoted by $ S = \{ e_1, e_2, e_3, ... e_n \} $ @enumerated Notation@.

'Belongs To',

r'''
An element $ \lambda $ belongs to a @set@ S $ \biimpl $ $ \exists! \tau \in S \mid \lambda = \tau $ @equality@.
Denoted by $ \lambda \in S $.

An element $ \lambda $ does not belong to a S $ \biimpl $ $ \nexists \tau \in S \mid \lambda = \tau $.
Denoted by $ \lambda \in S $.

r'''
To indicate whether an element belongs to a set or not.
There cannot be more than one element in S that is equal to $ \lambda $ anyways due to the definition of a set.
